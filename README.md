# Chia Wallet for Node.js

[![npm package](https://nodei.co/npm/chia-wallet-lib.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/chia-wallet-lib)

Please note that this library is primarily for educational purposes, has not been thoroughly tested, and is not intended to be used in production unless you know what you are doing.

This package contains an example Chia wallet implementation, as well as implementations for the Standard Transaction and CAT primitives. It uses the full node RPC (not the light wallet protocol) to sync the wallet and make transactions, so it will only work with a local full node running.
